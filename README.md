# EmbeddedSystems_Arm

Repo of my solutions to the projects in the 'Embedded Systems Essentials with Arm: Getting started' course

The assignments are made with Mbed online compiler and Mbed simulator


## COURSE DESCRIPTION

Get practical without hardware. Quickly prototype and build microcontroller projects using industry-standard APIs.

- Learn how to implement real-world embedded system projects on a simulated microcontroller using the Mbed API.

- Modify skeleton code to implement functionality for multiple applications:

      - an audio wave generator
      - an audio player
      - controlling peripherals using analog and digital I/O interfaces
      - interrupts
      - timers
      - pulse width modulation.

- Learn key features of Arm processors and architectures as the basis of modern embedded computing.

- Understand applications of embedded systems and how a modern API can help accelerate IoT deployment.

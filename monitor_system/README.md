# PWM_analogIO

Using the mbed simulator to generate sound, using analog I/O and PWM(pulse width modulation)

The assignments are made with Mbed online compiler and Mbed simulator

## ASSIGMENT

Create a saw-tooth sound wave

Bonus: I added interrupts buttons: switch type of wave (between saw-tooth and triangle), and play and pause buttons
